# Functional Threshold Pace (FTPa)
These two options are common methods to estimate the lactate
threshold (LT) or threshold pace, especially for runners who want
 to adjust their training based on effort zones.

## 1) Run for 20 minutes
Run for 20 minutes at a strong but sustainable pace. At the end, calculate
your average pace. Multiply the average pace by 1.05 (or add 5% to the
time per kilometer). The result will be your estimated threshold pace.
Example: **Average pace over 20 minutes: 4:30 min/km. 5% of 4:30 is about 0:13 seconds.
Estimated threshold:('Ftpa') f4:43 min/km**

## 2) Run for 30 minutes:
Run for 30 minutes at a strong but steady pace. Calculate the average pace
during this period. This average pace will be your threshold directly,
with no adjustments needed. **Example: Average pace over 30 minutes: 4:45 min/km.
Threshold: 4:45 min/km**.
Which one to choose?
20-Minute Run: A good option if you're already used to running at high intensity and can maintain a strong pace in a controlled manner. The 5% adjustment compensates for the shorter test duration.
30-Minute Run: Ideal for those who prefer a more straightforward method and are willing to sustain a strong pace for a longer period.
Both methods provide a good estimate and can be used to guide interval training or effort-based zones. Have you tried either of these methods?
